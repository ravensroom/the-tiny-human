title: What does "strawberry picking" mean to you?
---

A year later, when Bird tried to explain to Monkey why he walked away from the party in the park, he couldn't help recalling the day when Bunny and Cat took him to pick strawberries.

For God's sake, it's strawberry picking! It was a warm sunny day, and it was the first time Bird had been to a strawberry field. The strawberries were red and juicy. Bird enjoyed it. Bunny and Cat were glad that Bird was having fun. You can see how happy Bird was from the photos where he presented big smiles.

Why did Bird think "strawberry picking" had anything to do the loner behavior he showed at the party then?

In Bird's mind, the joy others thought he had was simply a mechanical response to the environment. He was a victom. He made sacrifices in favor of others' wishes. When a request comes inviting him to pick strawberries, he couldn't think and somehow said "yeah!". He knew he didn't need "entertainment" like this and it won't help him with his mind. In a life of urgency like his, he never had enough time to think for himself, let alone spending his attention on "strawberry picking".

He owns already so little of his life, and now he needs to go strawberry picking. The more strawberries he picks, the less he owns of his life. He owns so little already, how much harm can it do to just spend and waste it all? Sometimes there's no Bird left in the strawberry field, but a robot zombie smiling to the camera.

When does strawberry picking become Bird's enemy that crushes his soul and commits a bunch of other crimes?

At a time when Bird says "yeah!" when he could simply say "no". And because of the unfaithly "yeah!", Bird begins to calculate how much of himself he has lost and zones himself out out of the averison of the loss and whoever puts him in this situation. The resentment and the bitterness keep growing until Bird had to snap and walk away from the party.

But strawberry picking is simply, strawberry picking. Isn't it?

There's no other acceptable meaning of strawberry picking other than recognizing that it's a mistake Bird makes to his mind that hurts his relationship with the world and with others, if it should have a special meaning. The meaning of strawberry picking is never about the "mundane, unpleasant, non-profitable, unworthy nature" of strawberry picking, which effectively includes watching television, playing board games, going to the museum, socializing..., and all other subsets of humane activities. They are but..., themselves.

What makes it a mistake?

When Bird knows what to do about himself, it's not so difficult for him to say "no". But when Bird feels uncertain in life, which happens a lot, it can be easy to slide into a state of following blindly whenever there's someone leading a way. But remember, at the time of uncertainty, Bird is in the state where he feels most urgent to think for himself, and the more he's deprived of that opportunity because his mind had been too weak to say "no", the more far away he is from finding his own way again. And how can strawberry picking not be a joyful escape from that duty! And how can Bird not feel empty and drained of energy after escaping his duty!

The reasons for saying "no" are clear: Bird needs to repect his true needs, otherwise his unfaithful "yeah!" will incur pain in himself as well as an unfair blame for strawberry picking or for other people. If Bird is hesitant, the wise decision will be to let him be with himself until you have his invitation. In the end, nobody wishes Bird says "yeah!" when he doesn't mean it.

Monkey: "Bird, is this event strawberry picking for you? You don't need to go if it is."
Bird: "Wrong question. Let's try again."

Monkey: "Bird, do you want to go strawberry picking?"
Bird: "Yeah!"
Monkey: "**Are you** strawberry picking?"
Bird: "yeah..."
Monkey: Let's try again."

Monkey: "Bird, do you want to go strawberry picking?"
Bird: "No. I want to do my own things."
Monkey: "Yeah!"
