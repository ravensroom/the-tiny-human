title: Dreaming the Tiny Human
---

The tiny human was once a concubine of the emperor,
so insiginificant and fearful.

The palace was an immense labyrinth,
its grand chambers unfathomably formidable.

Supreme power and wealth sat behind an unreachable deepness,
she was but the lowest of the low.

No knowledge of the emperor's face,
no knowledge of the rules.

Where to find a firmness to hold,  
the ladder to climb, the rope to pull?

---

One day she woke up in a tiny body,
as tiny as the nail of a thumb.
never to grow up, never to bear an heir.

A nanny had raised the tiny human,
secret bloodline of the royal family,
mystic creature of the palace.

The emperor came to the tiny human,
asking it to tell his fortune.
Only to find a threat to his throne.

Before the emperor could make a move,
with one swift jump, the tiny human escaped,
far to an unreachable river, turning back,
grinning slyly, waving goodbye.

What of the emperor's face,
What of the rules?

Moving its tiny legs,
working its vigorous body,
running incredibly fast afar.
