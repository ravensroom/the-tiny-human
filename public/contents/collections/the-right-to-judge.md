> “How should one deal with people who habitually judge others?”

“Not judging others” is a very important principle.
But at the same time, people cannot help but judge others.

For instance, when hiring employees, you need to choose from several candidates; when dating, you often need to choose among several people; when selecting suppliers, you always have to choose from a few options.

Ultimately, you have to make choices and judgments; without making choices or judgments, your life cannot continue. And the subjects of choice and judgment are often people, which is unavoidable.

So, how does one practice the lesson of “not judging others”?

**First, consider the authority, that is, the right to judge.**

Before judging, consider whether you have the right to judge the person or matter.

A judge has the right to judge those under legal jurisdiction in terms of punishment; a teacher has the right to judge students in academic matters; an employer has the right to judge matters related to their employees...

Everyone has the right to judge matters they are consulted about.

You need to realize that people have the freedom to be free from judgment, and this freedom should not be infringed upon. Unless the person in question has relinquished their right not to be judged in some form and is willing to subject themselves to someone else's judgment, you have no right to judge them. **Only when asked to judge and given authorization, your judgment is not considered an infringement on others' freedom.**

You must see some form of “permit” before you can begin your judgment.

Such “permissions to judge” are sometimes obtained through implicit invitations, for example, if you are a doctor and someone makes an appointment, this permits your judgment. Similarly, if you are answering someone's question on Zhihu[^1] and they have asked for an answer, it naturally equates to giving authorization.

But in this, you must be careful **to avoid judging someone at the invitation of another who does not have authorization over them.** If someone invites you to judge another, you must first check if the inviter has the right to judge that person. For example, is the inviter the guardian of the other? If so, that's acceptable. Is the inviter the other person's doctor? If so, then you can be invited to participate in a consultation regarding that person’s illness.

At the same time, you also need to check the scope of the authorization given by the other person, considering whether the judgment right granted by the other to the inviter includes permission to be transferred. For example, a privately practicing psychologist does not have the right to invite others for a consultation without authorization. But if a patient seeks treatment at a clinic and the contract is signed with the clinic, then this may include all employed doctors at the clinic. If you are also a colleague of this doctor, if you are invited, then you have the right to judge,

Indeed, the issue of judgment rights is so subtle, complex, and serious. Therefore, for the sake of rigor and caution, it's best to make the authorization issue explicit and clear — for example, if you're unsure, just directly ask the other person if they are seeking your judgment on a certain matter, and if you don’t receive a clear affirmative answer, simply discontinue. Or you must have a clearly indicated authority in advance, so that anyone who contacts you in that context is automatically declaring themselves subject to your judgment.

**To give a classic and relevant example, you have the editorial right to delete and collapse any responses in your own answer's discussion area on Zhihu, this means that anyone who posts in your discussion area is automatically declaring their willingness to accept your judgment to delete or collapse their responses.**

Under this premise, you can freely exercise the authority granted to you, without worrying about the other party's "protests" - because essentially, this is just the other party being inconsistent, lacking credibility, or a correct understanding of social contracts.

This is not your problem, and regardless of your conscience, there is no issue of "violating others' freedom."

Protesting against the answerer for deleting or collapsing one's own responses in the discussion area is a manifestation of unclear social responsibility, insensitivity to contractual relationships, and immature ethical understanding.

Based on the same rule, if you write a lengthy response - or even a single word - under someone else's answer, you must be mentally prepared for the possibility of being deleted or collapsed, understanding that the other party has this complete freedom, and that by writing, you are essentially signing a waiver agreement.

So, wisely speaking, if you intend to make any judgment that could be seen as impolite by the other party, it is better to write your own answer, rather than going under someone else's answer to "demand respect for freedom of speech."

The best way to resolve disputes is not to "seek consensus," but to be autocratic in each other's areas of authority, and then let each live their own fate.

If you enter my domain, you accept my judgment; if I enter your domain, I honestly accept your judgment.

In fact, the freedom from judgment exists only in the public domain. What is the public domain? — Outside the scope of private rights.

**Secondly, an effective trick to avoid judging others is to strive to increase the value of one's own judgments.**
To what extent? **To the extent that others would pay for your judgment, or compete for the opportunity to be judged by you.**
When your judgment becomes so valuable to others, you will learn to cherish it.
Your judgment has market value; would you still throw it around everywhere? Does the other party really deserve it?

At this level, you naturally won't easily make the mistake of judging others.
Not only will you not make this mistake, but even if someone asks for your judgment, you will rigorously evaluate whether their invitation truly has quality - whether the etiquette is complete, the attitude is correct, the sincerity is genuine - whether they really deserve it.
If not a visitor to the thatched cottage thrice, who has the virtue and ability to deserve the plan for dividing the world into three parts?[^2]

Cultivating this level of judgment is no easy task.
Your own knowledge, experience, cultivation, and even your attitude towards faith are closely related to your "invitation value."

Among all these, the most influential is the willingness and ability to love.
It's the faith and hope others have in your love.
If there is no faith and hope in your love, no matter how superior your knowledge, how can it be believed to be beneficial to oneself?

In fact, why do people always try to usurp the power of judgment? **It is actually out of envy for those who have the power to judge.**
**They are too envious of those who have the authority of 'a word spoken, and the listener takes to heart'. But they never understand where this authority comes from - it is not from your knowledge and abilities, that is just the ability to love - but from the willingness to love, from the faith and hope of the one seeking judgment in this willingness.**

> If I speak in the tongues of all men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. (1 Corinthians 13:1-2 NIV)

What makes your judgment have a value that touches people's hearts,
is not your status, your diploma, your abilities, your qualifications,
but the love behind it that directly touches to one's heart.

Then we need to return to ourselves.
Everyone has the innate freedom to be free from the judgment of others.
People can capture you, judge you, sentence you, imprison you, even kill you. But as long as your heart does not accept the other's right to judge, all these are merely different forms of violence and do not constitute a true judgment.

Would it be that if a group of robbers bound you on the road, put on a show to judge you for the "crime of not wanting to be robbed," and then sentenced you to "death," you would really be "guilty"?
Do you see?
Essentially, the freedom from judgment is a divine grant, a priori, and must be exercised or abandoned by the person themselves before it becomes a state that can be judged.

Only when you accept the other's right to judge, does the other have the right to judge you.
The other's judgment result is thus not just a result of violent superiority, but also a respect for your own freedom.
"I acknowledge that the judgment of this judge on my specific range of actions is more just than my own, and I accept them to execute this judgment in my place, until I cancel this authorization." - This is the essence of an **ethical relationship**.

I'll say it again - this is the essence of an **ethical relationship**.
We are not talking about "association," not about "mutual influence," but about a real "relationship," the kind of **ethical relationship** that can be identified as friend or foe, close or distant, supportive or opposed.

As long as any two people establish such a conscious, sober "handover/delegation of judgment rights" association, they are no longer unrelated strangers in any sense, and there is an undeniable close relationship between them.

As long as you understand this sentence, you can see the root of all loneliness.
You lack enough courage to truly hand over this right of judgment to anyone, so you cannot establish real relationships with people.
You also lack enough love, so no one dares to hand over this right of judgment to you, thus you are unable to establish real relationships with people from another perspective.

This is the root of **loneliness**, this is the source of the abyss-like darkness of life.

[^1]: 知乎(www.zhihu.com) —— a popular question-and-answer platform on the Chinese Internet, similar to Quora.
[^2]: 三顾茅庐，三分天下 —— This phrase alludes to the story of Liu Bei, a warlord, who visited the scholar Zhuge Liang three times at his thatched cottage to seek his advice and assistance in his ambition to divide and rule the land. Zhuge Liang, known for his wisdom, initially declined to meet Liu Bei. Only after Liu Bei's persistent and respectful visits did Zhuge Liang agree to help him, showcasing the importance of perseverance, respect, and recognizing the value of wise counsel in Chinese culture. This story is emblematic of the respect for intellect and the lengths one might go to seek valuable guidance, emphasizing the importance of earnest and persistent effort in earning the trust and cooperation of others.
