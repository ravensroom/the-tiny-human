Me: Mayfly, oh mayfly, please tell me, what is the best way to sustain life?

Mayfly: What time is it?

Me: It's 6:47 in the evening.

Mayfly: Ah! The sun has already set! I, who live in the morning and die in the evening, will take this question as a gift on my journey.

After saying this, the mayfly straightened up a bit and died.

A voice nearby said: Not clinging to life, nor refusing death, good Mayfly, oh good Mayfly, you truly lived freely.

Such uncommon words must come from no ordinary being. I hurriedly gestured to the air: I don't know which immortal is speaking, please show yourself and let's talk.

But the voice came from below, a small ant put down a grain and said as it turned around: It's me, it's me!

Not wanting to be rude, I asked: Ant, oh ant, please tell me, what is the best way to sustain life?

Ant: Puff, I, the little ant, only know to scurry about every day. When I find food, I carry it back to the nest. I labor tirelessly all my life, never even once seeing Her Majesty the Queen. When I'm utterly exhausted, my body becomes so thin and light that a gust of wind could blow me away, and from then on, no one will remember that I once lived in this world. Living a life ike this, I don't even have time to stop and think every day, how can I answer your question?

Me: Working hard without counting gains and losses, isn't that also a kind of life preserving?

Ant: Haha, that's just preserving life for others—

It shook its head, picked up the grain, as if stopping to say these words was already a transgression. Just as it was about to leave, a chicken rushed over and pecked, eating it in one bite.

Me: How could you do that!

The chicken proudly raised its head, tilting to look at me with one eye: All things coexist, everything is permissible, ants can eat, why can't I?

Me: But by eating it, it dies.

The chicken flapped its wings: If it doesn't die, how can I live? Cluck cluck cluck!

Me: Must life necessarily be sustained by another life?

Chicken: Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

Me: I'm vegetarian, I don't kill chickens! When I see you being killed, I even buy and release you to accumulate merit!

Chicken: What the heck is accumulating merit?

Me: It's about saving up the good deeds you've done, to exchange them for a longer life with the King of Hell in the future. They say that saving a life will sprout seven Red Tower Mountains[^1] in the otherworldly land. By now, my Red Tower Mountains must have almost grown into a stone forest.

Chicken: Wow! The King of Hell sure has a big smoking habit... Doesn't it burn his head?

Me: He also drinks a lot! Every time I make offerings, I splash three or five cups.

Chicken: Then your life should be long enough, why keep accumulating?

Me: I'm scared! Besides, how do I know how long my life will be? Maybe I have fifty years of life, and I've only accumulated an extra half a year. Maybe I'll die tomorrow. Without accumulating more, how can I feel at ease?

Chicken: No wonder you're asking about sustaining life everywhere, turns out you're just afraid of death!

Me: Hey, that's easy for you to say, aren't you afraid?

Chicken, puffing out its chest and stretching its neck: Is fear useful? Buddy, we're all going to die someday, and it's likely to be a sudden death, probably getting my neck chopped for bloodletting. Do you think I'd stop eating because of that?

Me: Wow... you're even more enlightened than a mayfly.

Chicken: I can't claim that. In my opinion, life is just a matter of lying down or standing up. Die lying down, and it's a sudden death. Die standing up, and it's a natural death. Me and the mayfly are a perfect pair of examples for this.

Me: ...That's actually true.

Chicken: As long as you understand. Anyway, death is inevitable one way or the other. If you spend each day worrying about it, you'll be badly tormented by fear.

Me: ...So, letting go of the fear of death and living bravely is the real way to sustain life...

Chicken: Still thinking? My words are called "chicken crack," and you can still make sense out of them, so you're still using your brain, aren't you?

Me, enlightened: That's so true! May I ask for your distinguished name, Brother Chicken? Let's get acquainted, as I have much to learn from you in the future.

Chicken: Don't be so formal, just call me "Louis XVI."

Qian'er: (ღ˘⌣˘) It's even a foreign chicken.

Me (slapping my sleeve and kneeling on one knee): I pay my respects to the King of Hell.

Qian'er: Empty words. Hurry up and chop the chicken, add some Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, some white wine, chop a green onion, pour in some mineral water and stew it all together, got it?

Me: We've run out of mineral water here.

Sun Yue: Where's the mineral water?

Me: I released it into the river...

Sun Yue (flinging his sleeve): Hey! Dumb ass! Even if you live a long life, you're just wasting food!
