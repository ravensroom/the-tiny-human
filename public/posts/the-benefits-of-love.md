> What are the benefits of loving someone?

This answer was originally to answer the following question:

[How do you view the case where a father-in-law stabbed and killed his son-in-law's family? Is the death sentence with a reprieve reasonable?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/453398263/answer/1825213617) It is suggested to first look at the various answers under that question, and then read the following.

There is a method to assess whether a person's mentality is mature, which is to observe their standpoint or tendencies when they view social news.

This does not refer to whether the person supports or opposes a certain view, but rather looks at **what kind of empathy** they use to express these views.

Among the **least mature** behaviors is to empathize with a specific role in an event based on one's gender, class, or other perceived unchangeable attributes, or the beautiful fantasy that one is an absolutely innocent angel.

You should calmly and quietly observe – when this person expresses their views, in whose identity and role do they stand, filled with righteous indignation?

The less mature one's mentality, the more they tend to have a firm and stubborn imagination about their own life.

Based on this imagination, they start from the present moment and end at the average lifespan, setting a predetermined state for themselves at every moment.

Then they compare all roles in the event with every sampling point on this "self-expectation curve," choose the point closest to the entire curve, and firmly stand **and only stand** in the position of this role to analyze pros and cons, and present views - **always** the closest one, **always just** the closest one.

This kind of predictability, similar to animal instinct, is a characteristic of humans not yet having evolved from a juvenile state driven by instinctive fear rather than abstract, comprehensive thinking.

At this stage, even though humans have far superior thinking skills compared to other animals, they still rely solely on their instincts for the most fundamental yet abstract, and complex issues - such as friend/foe, true/false, good/evil, benefit/harm - flying straight like a bee captivated by the fragrance of flowers.

The crux of this behavior lies in the superstition, or rather, not yet disillusioned with, one's subconscious predictions about fate.

To **believe** in one's fate according to one's **imagination** of it is a kind of unconscious arrogance.

What's the subtext? Isn't it "I am my own God, what I think in my heart will surely come to pass"?

Don't be fooled; the **content** of the view "I will accomplish nothing" is extremely self-deprecating, but the **attitude** of holding this view is **utterly arrogant**.

They just think that as long as the content of their self-prediction is humble enough, they are "humble", but they do not realize that the real crux is not in the content of the view they hold, but in the attitude with which they hold it.

One is still humble when holding the most noble views with a humble attitude. One is still arrogant when holding the most humble views with an arrogant attitude.

Are we off-topic now?

What does this have to do with the current question?

The key to the relationship is this - **those who understand that life is unpredictable and anything can happen, will not simply put themselves in any single role in a story.**

Being young doesn't mean one can't empathize with the elderly in a story,

Being poor doesn't prevent one from understanding the rich in a story,

Being just a civilian doesn't stop one from putting themselves in the shoes of an official in a story,

Feeling innocent doesn't mean one can't empathize with the defendant in a story,

Being ignorant doesn't prevent one from understanding the elite in a story,

**And being a man doesn't mean one can't understand the perspective of a woman in a story.**

Because someone who has somewhat experienced life's vicissitudes and truly seen the impermanence of the world, will be given an inescapable clear realization—that if such a thing truly befalls them, it's hard to predict what role they will play in the story.

You are poor now, but when this situation occurs, will you still be, for sure?

You are an employee now, but when this situation occurs, will you still be, for sure?

You are young now, but when this situation occurs, will you still be, for sure?

You are a novice now, but when this situation occurs, will you still be, for sure?

Do you see the issue here?

The pattern gets "stuck" at the phrase, "You are a man now, but when this situation occurs, will you still be, for sure?"

"I'm a man, and I reasonably expect not to become a woman in my lifetime. Empathizing with the elderly, officials, bosses seems reasonable, but empathizing with women, isn't that a bit too far?"

**Is it really stuck?**

For you, is there someone in this world who, **no matter what, if they're harmed, it's as if you are harmed**?

**Is there someone who, even if they join with another, or even stand against you, remains just the same in your heart, and if they are harmed, it's as if you are harmed?**

If you don't have such a person, then—

Do you believe you **will have** such a person?

Will that person be hindered by any of these constraints?

Do you see?

**Impermanence and love, effortlessly and delicately, eradicate the rationale of excluding yourself from any role in the story.**

Knowing impermanence, you've already crossed half the boundary.

Knowing the power of love, you cross the other half.

**Any role in the story could potentially be you.**

Even if the gender of that role is different from yours.

**Because the person you love is an inseparable part of you.**

This awareness leads to one's natural possession of "super vision" towards events, without the need to go through psychological construction, self-persuasion, constant vigilance, or any other thought-consuming steps.

A vision that is entirely among all roles in the story, yet transcends above them all—almost with a divine perspective.

What does "no energy-consuming steps required" mean?

It means that not only will they apply this vision to such tragedies, shocking news, historical rises and falls, national affairs, but also to various daily aspects of family, learning, life, work... and everything else.

Because this self-awareness, once established, becomes an inseparable part of one's cognition, and those who reach this stage can't really go back. Even if they want to only empathize with the role most similar to themselves, and forcibly stay in that position without naturally shifting to another role, they can't.

Every moment's perceptions naturally become part of the training set for this way of thinking, reaching heights **far beyond** those narrow-minded and pitiable opponents, naturally forging abilities beyond their wildest dreams.

Thus, it is of no surprise that this genuinely allows the former to attain the various potential futures that the latter believes to be utterly impossible.

**Life is the sum of possibilities, while death is the loss of them.**

Think about what this means?

It means that **in an absolute sense, the former lives better than the latter.**

From another perspective, due to this natural limitation of "not being able to determine what my role will be," it's easy for one to detach from the usual moral judgment standpoint in viewing the progression of events. This provides a much higher and more reliable judgment ability regarding the development of events, reactions of various related characters, and deductions about the relationships between characters.

This has crucial significance for secular success.

Do you see the brilliance in this?

Are those who cry and shout, "I've been wronged in love, love is fake and useless," truly in love?

**Whether you are truly in love doesn't require asking others what the standard for love is.**

**If you haven't gained this super-visual instinct or improved your super-visual ability because of it, then it's not love.**

This truth is as plain as a brick that could break your head.

This is also why people generally experience a leap in cognitive ability after a deeply memorable romance or becoming a parent — because these two events at least open the prison door to the cell next door.

What is the reward for love?

Is it about whom you "love" and what they give you in return?

**The first reward of love is this super-vision. (Note the word "first").**

Love, and you have it.

Love more, gain more.

**No rejection for any who come, absolutely fair.**

**Instant payment,**

**Response like a deity.**

Therefore, when concluding that "this is a male/female rights issue," think more about why you do so.

Don't advocate for male rights just because you are male, and think that advocating for male rights is the most reasonable for you.

Because this, at best, only helps you win some modification of the social contract, but it is a symptom of a "super-vision obstacle."

Don't assume that supporting women's rights, regardless of one's reasons, is inherently a kind of foolishness just because you're a male.

Because even if the social contract doesn't make modifications favorable to you, supporting those different from yourself out of love also grants super-vision.

And the crux is here — people are not wrong, the world is indeed very realistic, but they are commonly mistaken about its actual mechanisms:

**For this world, the so-called "social contract" is nothing but a piece of waste,**

**It is always simple, ruthless, devoid of any emotion, without any capacity for caring or indulgence toward you.**

In the eyes of the world, male/female rights are just self-deceptive tricks of humanity, almost indistinguishable from noise,

**Super-vision, however, is an ability, the kind that scans and opens doors for you.**

For those who damage the latter for the former, or even just delay the latter, what kind of foolishness is that, do you understand?

As a male, why should you support female rights, do you understand?

As a female, why should you support male rights, do you understand?

Think about it, for your own life.
